Does your project run without error?: No

If not, what is/are the error(s) and which parts of your program run
correctly?:

There's no proper permissions in place to stop users from accessing accessing certain pages by entering 
urls directly if the pattern is known. So if someone else is logged in, another session that isn't logged in
could access the logged in user's information with the right URL put in.

I tried my best with resstricting this so this wouldn't happen with the buttons and links all users are shown.

Also, for every chat room, you have to click the "Submit" button to make the POST request. If you hit the 
Enter key instead, the request would not be sent.



Additional comments to the grader: Hope you're having a great day when you see this.
